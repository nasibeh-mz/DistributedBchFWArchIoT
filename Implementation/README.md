# Implementation
> **Note:** This repo is under development ‚õè. Expect more features to be added and changes to be made.

This section contains the details about the implementation of the project.

The project has three main components:

- The blockchain application contains the smart contracts to be deployed on the blockchain network.

- The client application contains the agents that let users interact with the application.

- The front-end application contains simple front-end clients to let users interact with the client application in a more visual and easier way.

They are supported by an IPFS network and the Hyperledger Fabric test network. The architecture has the following structure:

![Architecture](Architecture.drawio.png?raw=true "Architecture")

## Blockchain Application

The technology used for implementing the blockchain network is Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric allows to create private permisioned networks
that do not require heavy consensus algorithms like PoW. 

In the current version of the project the test network is used. Check the instalation section down bellow for details.

The smart contracts in Hyperledger Fabric are contained in groups called chaincodes. We implement them using the node.js version of Hyperledger Fabric SDK.

The contracts and the chaincode are implemented in [Chaincode](./RegisterChaincode).

## Client Application

The client applications is composed by three agents: [Author](./AuthorAgent), [Register](./RegisterAgent), [Retrieval](./RetrievalAgent/) and [Verification](./VerificationAgent/). Each one of these agents is composed by one or few Docker images that contain a 
node.js application. 

The node applications serve a RESTful API that let users (authors and devices) interact with the blockchain network application. For more details about the data flow
and structure of the project, see [Design](../Design).

The technologies and libraries used for the agents are the following:

- Node.js

- Express framework for route handling

- Jest library for unit testing

- Supertest library for testing API endpoints

- MongoDB for storage/databases

- Mongoose for connection to databases and data structure handling

- Swagger/OpenAPI for functional testing and documentation

- Docker for image contention

- Fabric SDK

- IPFS HTTP Client

## Front-end Application

The front-end application is comprised by the [author-app](./author-app/) and the [device-app](./device-app/). They are both made using react (made with create-react-app) and material ui. They can be used to interact with the agents though a GUI. They are implemented mainly for testing purposes.


## Instalation and prerequesites

- This repository needs a previous instalation of docker and docker compose. 
- Node and npm also need to be installed for development purposes. 
- The repository is currently tested against the hyperledger fabric test network, which has to be installed in case you have not any other network installed. 
- Finally you need access to an IPFS (private) network. A single Docker contained node is being used in development.

The contents of [FabricScripts](./fabricScripts/) can be placed in (your hyperledger installation path)/fabric-samples/test-network to help to reduce time when setting up the test network, installing and updating the chaincode.

To get the repository working in a local environment, please follow the instructions:

1. Initialize the test network and install [RegisterChaincode](./RegisterChaincode/). This can be done with 
    ```
    sudo sh <test-network-folder>/startHyperledger.sh <path to chaincode> <name for chaincode instalation ,ex: register>
    sudo sh <test-network-folder>/installCCOne.sh <name>
    sudo sh <test-network-folder>/installCCTwo.sh <ID given in terminal> <name>
    ```
    If you make any changes to the chaincode and want to test it, you can use
    ```
    sudo sh <test-network-folder>/updateOne.sh <path to chaincode> <name> <version> 
    sudo sh <test-network-folder>/updateTwo.sh <ID given in terminal> <name> <version> 
    ```
    It is important that version increases by one everytime you update the chaincode.
2. Copy the connection-org1.json file from test-network/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com into /RegisterAgent/src/config.
3. Delete contents of RegisterAgent/src/wallet
3. Update connection-org1.json to include the gateway address from your network instead of localhost.
4. Initialize your IPFS node/network. If you dont have one, you can use the [custom private network implementation](./IPFS) or you can try using the public Docker image using the following command.
    ```
    docker run -d --name ipfs_host --network fabric_test -e IPFS_PROFILE=server -v $ipfs_staging:/export -v $ipfs_data:/data/ipfs -p 4001:4001 -p 4001:4001/udp -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:5001:5001 ipfs/kubo:latest
    ```
    Update /RegisterAgent/src/config/config.json to add the connection url, for example "http//localhost:5001".
5. Use the script build.sh to initialize the RegisterAgent. It will run the scripts to intialize the node app and register it to the blockchain network.
6. Use the build.sh script from AuthorAgent to initialize it.
7. Use the build.sh script to initialize VerificationAgent.
8. Use the build.sh scripts to initialize author-app and device-app. You can acces them though ports 2999 and 3004 respectively, and they can be used to test the proyect.
