# Author App

This app is a simple React application intended to simplify the interaction with the Author Agent API.

It allows to select keys from local files, and petitions the author agent to sign manifest and payloads.

(Sometimes buttons need to be clicked twice for manifests to be created correctly due to unhandled async)
