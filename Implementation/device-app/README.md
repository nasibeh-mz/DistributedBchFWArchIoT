# Device App
This is a simple react aplication that allows users to mimic a device for the retrieval process. Given a public key (from a local storage file) and a classID, the app can petition the retrieval agent and get the latest available update.

It can also perform verifications thorugh the verification agent. If you want to test an invalid verification case, you can modify the manifest after retrieving it.
