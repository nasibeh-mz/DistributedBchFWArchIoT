# Distributed blockchain-based firmware update architecture for IoT devices

The objective of this project is to design and implement a distributed firmware update architecture based on blockchain, for which we intend to use the foundations defined by the [SUIT working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/suit/about/) in the [RFC9019](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9019.pdf), adapting them to a distributed environment based on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain.
