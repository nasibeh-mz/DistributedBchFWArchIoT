# Distributed blockchain-based firmware update architecture for IoT devices - Meeting notes for 27/02/2023

## Minutes

- This minute is created by [Jesús Rugarcía](https://github.com/jesusrugarcia).

## Closed issues and decisions

- Signed messages are now also hashed for proper signing.
- Retrieval processes are implemented.
- The IPFS network deployment is implemented.
- Full instalation process is documented.
## Open issues and questions
- Register author process now will not be permanent. The register key / JWT generated will have a clear expiration window, after wich the author will need to register again. This approach will reduce the risks of leaked register keys. If an author suspects the key has been leaked, they can ask for a new key anytime.
- Multipart form data support is needed in the APIs to support larger bin files.
- More eficient queries are recomendable. The current process is okay for small ammounts of updates, but they might scale poorly.

## Discussion and proposals
- Aplications (with frontend) can make the project more easily usable and allow cleared demos. They are interesting to implement.

- CI/CD pipelines should be introduced. Currently agents are viable, but chaincodes present challenges in their instalation / testing.

## Special note
