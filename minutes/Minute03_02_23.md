## Closed issues and decisions

- Established CI/CD workflow to be followed.

## Open issues and questions

- Implementation for the register process is being made.

## Discussion and proposals
- The testing needs communication between docker images to reproduce complete flows to successfuly test functional endpoints. Since github actions offers limited capabilities,
it is interesting to use external runners. https://github.com/minghsu0107/cicd-demo follows an interesting approach.
