# Distributed blockchain-based firmware update architecture for IoT devices - Meeting notes for 09/20/2023

## Minutes

## Closed issues and decisions

- Divided update retrieval into two requests, one for the payload and one for the rest of the update. A more efficient retrieval was achieved.
- From steps of making a contribution:
    1. Create strong  validation methods / meassure the performance of the application. --> a software tool for measuring performance is being used. Results are procesed using a python notebook.
    4. Analize previous contributions to search for validation methods. --> There is not any evidence presented in comparable works. Therefore the performance metrics shall be our validation (at least for the moment).
    5. Identify journals / conferences that may receive the proposal. --> by impact factor (aprox)

## Open issues and questions
The initial implementation is completed. The following steps are to be made in order to make an academic contribution:
2. Identify what makes the solution different from previous contributions.
3. Identify sources that prove the need for a solution. Explore academic contributions and referenceable institutions.


- Could not find any data about average firmware sizes. However, RFC 7728 clasifies type 2 as 250 KiB. Therefore a max payload size of 37ish MB should be much more than enough.
- Detected an error where a same key can be interpreted as a different string depending on where it is first read (app vs agent)
## Discussion and proposals

- Spydra may be interesting to include for testing chaincode (for future development).
