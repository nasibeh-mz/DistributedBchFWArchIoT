# Distributed blockchain-based firmware update architecture for IoT devices - Meeting notes for 13/01/2023

## Minutes

- This minute is created by [Santiago Figueroa](sfigueroa@ceit.es).

## Closed issues and decisions

- The Flow of the application is decided. Please check [Flow Diagrams](./FlowDiagrams).

- Manifests are not to be modified by the application. ContentID will be stored in table. This allows for less proccessing to be done.

- Manifest and Image verification will be done ON-chain.

- Manifest format will be compliant with that proposed by RFC 9124. Aditional fields are added to allow manifest verication. Please check [DataStructures] (./DataStructures/Update).

## Open issues and questions

- Data Structures for transactions need to be designed.

- Flows need to be updated to allow In-chain verification for images and manifests.

- General Flow needs to include IPFS net for clarity.

## Discussion and proposals

- Could be interesting to add IPFS verification ON-chain. Future work sugested.

## Special note
